I have been researching on [Wbridge5][wbr5], a prominent bridge program.  I was
confused that it disables [inverted minors][invm] by default.  Recently I came
up with conclusion.

> available.

Inverted minors originates from [Kaplan–Sheinwold][ks].  Inverted minors is
popular in East and Southeast Asia due to popularity of [Precision Club][prec],
based on K-S with [strong club][club], inheriting the weak notrump opening.

Nowadays, many ones open strong notrump according to [*somewhat American*][am].
However, some of them still employ inverted minors.  Inverted minors has pros
indeed, easily found by searching ["inverted minors"][duck].  Hence, I list
its cons as balance.

*Garbage* 1NT response
----------------------
Weakness of inverted minors is not on itself but the 1NT response modified
because of inverted minors.  The 1NT response may have the following meanings:

Constructive 1NT
: At least 6 tricks expected if both minimum.

*Garbage* 1NT
: Only 5 tricks expected if both minimum.

When partner opens 1♠, 1<span class="redsuit">♥</span>, or
1<span class="redsuit">♦</span>, not to miss a probable game, garbage 1NT is
*on* as the opponent passes.

If inverted minors is agreed, without intervention, garbage 1NT is always on.

If inverted minors is *off*, a constructive 1NT is ensured over 1♣ opening even
if intervened, as there is always a better call <small>i.e. a suit or
pass</small>.  Respond 2♣ with a weak 3-3-3-4 because the opener often has 4+
clubs.

If 1♣ ensures 3+ clubs
: With minimum strength, the probability of only 3 clubs is 21.5%.

If 1♣ can be 4-4-3-2
: With minimum strength, the probability of exactly 3 clubs is 20.4%，4-4-3-2 5.19%.

### Weak 4-card support dumped as garbage ###
Express 5-card support at 3 level preempts, but 1NT with 4-card support is much
less preemptive.  Is there so much difference between 2 of a minor and 1NT, as
1NT is just one or two bids lower?  Let's consider the following.

|   W   |  N  |     E     |  S  |
|-------|-----|-----------|-----|
|       | 1♣  |     -     | 1NT |
| X[^1] |  -  | **-**[^2] |  ?  |

[^1]: [Takeout double](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeout_double)
[^2]: Convert to business double

The point is not whether to escape, but the positive pass.  Notrump sucks for
the declarer, 6.06 tricks taken on average.  1NTxS−3 is more tragic than 3NTE=
unless favorable vulnerability.  In addition, the total notrump tricks may be
less than 13.

If 2♣ were responded, east must have had clubs to pass, positive advances
elevated onto 2NT.  *Preemption is force opponents bid high with strong hands.*
Although 2♣ is only one bid higher than 1NT, pass and cuebid are pushed onto
2NT.
